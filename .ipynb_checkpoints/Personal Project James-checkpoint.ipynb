    "In the beginning of 2020 there was a small outbreak of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. It quickly spread across the world, and the uncertainty was very high because of the high infectivity and long incubation time where there would be no symptoms at all. This is not the first time the world has encountered a pandemic. Throughout history, the black death, spanish flu, smallpox etc. have plagued humanity. Luckily, there are ways to make predictions of pandemics such as the coronavirus using the SIR model of infectious diseases. I wanted to investigate how the SIR model works and use Covid-19 as an example to showcase my take on this model with Python."

    "\n",
    "The SIR model of infection diseases is used to model and illustrate how diseases spread using (mainly) three dependent variables: **S**, **I** and **R** which stands for susceptible, infectious and removed respectively. In this case, the independent variable is **t** for time. The constants are **P** for population size, **d** for daily encounters, **a** for infectivity, **c** for number of infected people to start with, and **r** for rate of removal. In my model, I'm using a discrete time model to illustrate the change in numbers from day to day which is shown under:"

    "\n",
    "Covid-19 has been going on for over a year now and the SIR model is more relevant than ever. Obviously every country and region will have different constants or factors that affects the infectivity and removal rate of the disease, so lets take Norway as an example. Sources suggest that the *R number* of the coronavirus should be around 3 when there are no restrictions at all. The R number aka reproduction number is the average number of susceptible an infected will infect throughout the time they are contagious. As you probably can see, I'm not using a direct constant for the R number, I have split the R number into 3 parts that are proportional to each other, namely \"daily encounters\", \"infectivity and \"Susceptible/population (percentage of the daily encounters that are susceptible)\". This means that **d** multiplied by **a** should be 3 multiplied by **r**, which we know is around 0.05 (on average, a sick person with Covid-19 is no longer contagious at around the 20 day mark). So let's assign values **d**=10 and **a**=0.015 to begin with over the span of one year, and later we can adjust the numbers to fit different scenarios.\n",

So, how do we lower the R number? Let's say the government have locked down large parts of society, the **daily encounters** constant will go considerably down. By making masks mandatory, the government can lower the **infectivity** constant. Lastly, by vaccinating to achieve herd immunity, the government can successfully lower the percentage of the population that are susceptible, or **susceptible/population**.\n",

    "As a result of my study, I have found out that the reproduction number is crucial when looking at an infectious disease. Whether it is above or under 1 can result in completely different outcomes, With a R number of 1.1 the disease is bound to exponentially grow, while a R number of 0.9 the number of infected will gradually go down. If there would be a miscalculation of the R number, it could have massive consequences. I think that my analysis works pretty well for projecting future cases and trends, but it could be better. Improvements to the code could be adding more factors to the model, such as age, incubation time, population density and government reactions. "
